1. Core Strategies
2. Founding Theories
3. Derived Tactics

Core strategies are our guiding principles of how we approach the game.

Founding theories are perceived truths about the game,
which will shift, change, and grow, as our understanding improves and matures.

Derived tactics are specific methods based on the founding theories
designed to increase our chance of success at game time.



## Team Supporting Team

What can I do to help my team get better?

Everyone has a bad day.  Help them out.

Team spirit.  Team apparel for every practice and travel.


## Intentional, Maximal Practice

Make every contact an opportunity to get better,
using feedback to improve.
Maximize contacts per practice.

- Lots of game play with fewer players per team.
- Drills with pairs or triples.  No waiting in line.


## Athletic Diversity

Some of the best volleyball players are multisport athletes.


## Feedback

Feedback makes us better.

Identify useful tactics that are easy to measure and qualify.

### Feedback from Yourself

- After every contact, analyze.
- Did I know what I was doing before I did it?
- Was I in the right position?
- Was the contact clean?
- Did the ball go where I wanted it?
- What did I do good?
- What could have I done better?
- Try small adjustments to see if it improves or worsens.

### Feedback from your Teammates

- Give feedback to your teammates.  Often.  Practice and games.
- State the tactic and give a plus (whoop) or minus (buzzer).
  - "Zero Spin Serve.  Whoop!"
- Make it quick, don't make a big deal out of it, don't be a jerk.

### Feedback from your Games

- Analyze every game (real games and practice ones).
- What went well?
- What didn't?
- See a teammate struggle to get something right?
  - Take them aside and talk about it.
  - Be curious, not judgment (thank you Ted Lasso).
  - You might help them Escape Local Minima.


## Escape Local Minima

We all get stuck in performance plateaus.

Sometimes we need to get our of our comfort zone to learn
strange new skills to become a better player.


## Identify Improvements, Generalize, and Apply

See something work well?  Can a similar tactic we applied elsewhere in the game?

Applying benefits to other areas of the game is a force multiplier.

Example: Wow! That fast hit threw the defense off.

Identify: The quick hit was hard to counter.  The defense didn't have time to set up.

Generalize: Shortening the time from defense to attack can lead to a point.  How else can we shorten the time?

Apply: Keep passes low and fast, but still accurate.  This also speeds up the attack.


## Learn with Critical Thinking

Lots of YouTube videos.  Identify the good advice from the bad.  Both are useful.








# Founding Theories and Observations

- Slides are more efficient that 2-footed takeoff hits.
- Zero spin serves increase aerodynamic flutter.
- Fast attacks have higher likelihood of success.
- Blocking poses many risks.
  - Touch out of bounds.
  - Returns ball allow opponents to attack again.
  - Side block deflections hard to dig.
  - Net violations.
  - Ankle injuries.
  - Finger injuries.
- Well rounded players better than specialists.








# Core Tactics


## Just Average

Elevate the level of everyone's overall play.
Do not emphasize specialization.

Out of system play happens all the time, everyone must
compensate and perform during the unexpected.

- Everyone passes: No libero.
- Everyone hits: 6-2 over a 5-1.
- Everyone blocks: All players play MB.
- Everyone sets: 6-6.


## Inside Voices

Strong, assertive communication.
Over powers a cheering crowd.  Intimidates opponents.
Projects and strengthens self confidence and team confidence.


## Logistics and Support

Predict and identify when a teammate needs help.  Never wait for a call for help.
On a shanked pass or used block, immediately establish the "supply line" to
get the back back to the other side.

Support your teammates on and off the court.  Something as simple as fetching a bottle
and offering water can make all the difference.


## Ready Five

If you are not touching the ball or lining up to hit or block,
just assume next the ball will be hit hard in your direction.

Always be ready to pass.

Predict where the ball is going to go and be there in advance.


## Fast Attack

- Fast transition from defense to offense.
- Fast, accurate passing.
- Fast, low arcing sets.
- Quick hits.


## Attack on Two

When possible, attack on the second hit.


## No Spin Zone

Serves and downballs with zero spin have greater likelihood of
aerodynamic flutter, making them hard to pass.
Drive spin to zero.


## Block to Pass

Goal is to have the block deliver the ball up in the air in middle court
so it acts as a pass.
Block to cover hits to the middle of the court.
Don't penetrate the net.  Don't push.
Don't jump high.  Don't get used.
Angle slightly back.
Minimize chance of ball going off the side of the block.


## Late and Fast


## Pull Shot

Slide hitters run with the direction of the set, can decided when to hit the ball
along the net to make an opening in the block.


## Set from Left, Middle on Pin, Two Sliders


## Reduced Block

Situations to reduce the number of blockers down to 1 or none.

- Out of system.  Set from middle to back row.
- Bad pass, setter out.
- Identified weak hitter.
- One blocker on a tight set.
- One blocker on a middle set.  Rational: Outsides can't get in on time.
- No blockers after a certain point in a long volley.  Everyone is getting tired and hitting weak.
  Let front row conserve energy for hitting.


## Eagle Eye

Lots of serves fall near the endline.  Passers have a hard time judging in vs out.
One player (maybe, position #1) dedicated to calling in/out on the serve.
