# Strategies, Tactics, and Theories





# Strategic Hierarchy

1. Core Strategies
2. Core Tactics
3. Founding Theories

Core strategies is this list that guides everything else.

Core tactics are specific game play tactics observed by the team.
Each is given a name to be called out in feedback.  See Middle Loop Feedback.

Founding theories are ideas about the game that are thought to be true.
However, they may not be.
Therefore the founding theories must evolve as our understand of the game improves.





# Core Strategies


## Intentional Practice

Make every contact an opportunity to get better.
See Inner Loop Feedback.


## Maximal Practice

Maximize the number of contacts per practice.

- Lots of game play with fewer players per team.
- Drills with pairs or triples.  No waiting in line.


## Closed Loop Control (aka. Feedback)

Use feedback to get better.

### Inner Loop Feedback: Yourself

- After every contact, analyze.
- Did I know what I was doing before I did it?
- Was I in the right position?
- Was the contact clean?
- Did the ball go where I wanted it?
- What did I do good?
- What could have I done better?

### Middle Loop Feedback: Your Teammates

- Give feedback to your teammates.  Often.  Practice and games.
- State the tactic and give a plus (whoop) or minus (buzzer).
  - "Zero Spin Serve.  Whoop!"
- Make it quick, don't make a big deal out of it, don't be a jerk.

###Outer Loop Feedback: Your Games

- Analyze every game (real games and practice ones).
- What went well?
- What didn't?
- See a teammate struggle to get something right?
  - Take them aside and talk about it.
  - Be curious, not judgment (thank you Ted Lasso).
  - You might help them Escape Local Minima.


## Escape Local Minima

We all get stuck in performance plateaus.

Sometimes we need to get our of our comfort zone to learn
strange new skills to become a better player.


## Identify Improvements or degradation, Generalize, and Apply

See something work well?  Can a similar tactic we applied elsewhere in the game?

Applying benefits to other areas of the game is a force multiplier.

Example: Wow! That fast hit threw the defense off.

Identify: The quick hit was hard to counter.  The defense didn't have time to set up.

Generalize: Shortening the time from defense to attack can lead to a point.  How else can we shorten the time?

Apply: Keep passes low and fast, but still accurate.  This also speeds up the attack.


## Learn with Critical Thinking

Lots of YouTube videos.  Know the good advice from the bad.  Both are useful.


## Get Stronger to Go Faster, Get Higher, Hit Harder

Weight training.


# Core Tactics

## Zero Spin Serve

## Block to Pass

Goal is to have the block deliver the ball up in the air in middle court
so it acts as a pass.
Block to cover hits to the middle of the court.
Don't penetrate the net.  Don't push.
Don't jump high.  Don't get used.
Angle slightly back.
Minimize chance of ball going off the side of the block.

## Late and Fast

## Fast Pass

Fast, accurate passing.

## Pull Shot Slide

Slide hitters run with the direction of the set, can decided when to hit the ball
along the net to make an opening in the block.

## Predict Position

- Predict where the ball will go.
- Minimize movement needed to get there after the ball direction is clear.
- Ready stance.  Get off your heels.

## Predict Help

- Cover hitting.
- Run with team to support the save.
  - Be in position if they manage to get it up.

## Attack on 2

When possible, attack on the second hit.

## Set from Left, Middle on Pin, Two Sliders

## Reduced Blockers

Situations to reduce the number of blockers down to 1 or none.

- Out of system.  Set from middle to back row.
- Bad pass, setter out.
- Identified weak hitter.
- One blocker on a tight set.
- One blocker on a middle set.  Rational: Outsides can't get in on time.
- No blockers after a certain point in a long volley.  Everyone is getting tired and hitting weak.
  Let front row conserve energy for hitting.



# Founding Theories

## Slides are More Efficient that 2-Foot Takeoff Hits

## Zero Spin Serves Increase Aerodynamic Flutter

## Faster Attack Time has Higher Likelihood of Success

- Faster, lower passes.
- Faster, lower sets.
- Attack on 2.


## Blocking is a Risk

Blocking has some bad outcomes:

- Touch out of bounds.
- Returns ball allow opponents to attack again.
- Net violations.

When block is defeated (ball clears net),
when ball contacts top of the block instead of 
side of the block, defense can more easily recover.
Side of the block contacts leads to more out of bounds
and ball deflections that are hard to dig.
