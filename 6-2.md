# Abstract

To maximize available passers, reducing player travel and interfering with passing,
and to reduce the chance of the setter having to make first contact on serve receive,
we look at possible player positions in a 6-2,
specifically the optimal base positions of the front row
and their relation to the setter.

# Front Row Configurations and Rotating Rings

Given the three front row positions, **O**utside, **M**iddle, and **R**ightside,
they can be ordered in one of six possible base positions on the front row:

    O M R    O R M    M O R    M R O    R M O    R O M

When a player in P2 rotates to the back row, another player in P5 with the same
position rotates to the front row.
The following shows the successive rotations for each of the six configurations:


                   Config1  Config2  Config3  Config4  Config5  Config6
    Rotation n:     O M R    O R M    M O R    M R O    R M O    R O M
    Rotation n+1:   R O M    M O R    R M O    O M R    O R M    M R O
    Rotation n+2:   M R O    R M O    O R M    R O M    M O R    O M R
    Rotation n+3:   O M R    O R M    M O R    M R O    R M O    R O M
                                      ...

Note that after three rotations, the pattern repeats.
Also note that some configurations have the same pattern,
just out of phase.  For example, Config1, Config4, and Config6
each have a rotation where outside is on the left, middle is in 
the middle, and rightside is on the right (O M R).
Likewise, Config2, Config3, and Config5 have a rotation (R M O).
We call this a rotating ring of players as if forms
a ring of players in a certain order, either (O M R) or (R M O),
that rotate.
In the case where a lineup
has a rotation (O M R), we call this a normal rotating ring,
since in this position, the front row players are in their normal
home position.
When a lineup has a rotation (R M O), we call this a flipped rotating
ring since the outside and rightside players are flipped.


# Player Travel in Normal and Flipped Rotating Rings

We now consider the number of players that have to travel
to their home position in any given rotation, for
both normal ring and flipped ring configurations.

## Travel in a Normal Rotation Ring

    Rotation n:    O M R               No travel necessary.  Players are in their home position.

    Rotation n+1:  R O M  =>  O M R    R must travel from P4 to P2.

    Rotation n+2:  M R O  =>  O M R    O must travel from P2 to P4.

## Travel in a Flipped Rotation Ring

    Rotation n:    R M O  =>  O M R    R travels from P4 to P2.  O travels from P2 to P4.

    Rotation n+1:  O R M  =>  O M R    R travels from P3 to P2.

    Rotation n+2:  M O R  =>  O M R    O travels from P3 to P4.








# Conclusion

A main objective of player positioning in a 6-2 is
to minimize player traffic reducing the chance of traveling
players interfering with passing,
reduce the possibility of the setter having to make first contact,
and to maximize available passers during serve receive for all rotations.
Players that must travel to reach their home position on serve receive 
cannot pass, therefore we want to minimize the number of
players traveling on any given rotation.

Regardless of the lineup, the front row will form
a rotating ring of players in one of two configurations:
the normal ring (O-M-R) or the flipped ring (R-M-O).
The advantage of the normal ring over the flipped ring
is that it minimizes the number of players traveling on serve receive.
A normal ring has two rotations where one player travels (M-R-O, R-O-M)
and one rotation where all are starting in their home position (O-M-R).
Contrast this with the flipped ring that has two rotations
with one traveling player (M-O-R, O-R-M) and one rotation with two (R-M-O).

Though the setter is typically placed in front of the middle hitter
by two positions, e.g. setter at P1 and middle at P3,
this may not be optimal.  Observing that if the setter is
placed opposite the middle with the normal ring configuration,
the setter will always be behind the traveling player (either R at P4 or O at P2).
Therefore the setter and traveling front row player can start
at the net and use the net as a corridor to travel to 
their attack positions during serve receive,.
reducing interference with the passing players
and reducing the possibility that the setter has to take first contact.
In this scenario, each rotation has four dedicated passers.
