Migraines: Triggared by lack of sleep, stress, and excersize.
coaching guarantees 
Headache since May -- wouldn't trade it for the world.
Coaching these wonderful people is such a privledge.

Parent vs coach perspective of kids.

Funding challanges:
- Limited bussing to away games.
- No athletic trainer.
  - At coin toss refs required to ask if medical personal is on site.
  - At the last game I said we never have them.  She asks, don't you have an athletic trainer?
  - The Meridian coach nodded as said she has the same problem.
  - Joke that is was a good thing Chayse roller her ankle in Oak Harbor, because if it happened
    at home, no one would have been available to look her over.
- Ankle braces and knee pads are safety equipement.  Yet we treat it as optional.  Are football helments optional?
  To parents have to pay for football safety gear?
- Coaching salaries.  ~$5 per hour.
- General equipement disrepair.



Players:



# Josiah

Since I primarly coached C-Team last year,
I knew Jomi pretty well, but not so much her big sister
who played for JV.  Fortunately I was able to get 
aquanited with Josiah early last spring
and though she was a little quiet, something
resinatied with me about her leadership potential.
So at the start of this season she became my early pick for
team captain.  And a role that both her and Abi took very seriously.

Would always come to me to talk about the team, discuss any potential issues
that would come up, and make lots of great suggestions regarding practice
and games.  Many times she would just run things and I would let her
do it because she always made the right decisions.

For example, JV would usually be the first team warming up on practice day.
Josiah would have them running laps before I had finished getting
stuff out of the supply closet.

Another example was in our game agaisnt Meridian: we were down to one middle (both Merriit and Abi were out),
I came into practice the day before the game and Josiah immediately came over to me
and told me the situation and said
she has already talked with Bailey and Prudence: Bailey will be playing middle -- even
though she has never played middle before -- and Prudence will be in the full time on right-side.
Maybe some coaches would take issue with players making those kind of decisions,
but I thought, wow, whe has upper management written all over her.
And of course the decisions she made were the right ones.

And despite here size and her propensity to play back row,
Josiah somehow is able to serve the ball harder than anyone; not just
JV; anyone at BHS.
I can't serve the ball that hard.  I don't know how she does it.
Because it's a bit squirrely, I've had to warn
front row players not to turn their back when Josiah is serving.



# Indie

I appreiate Indie for many reasons.
First she is a great all-around player, in both hitting and defense,
and her serves are top notch.

Second, knowing about by migraine issues, she always asks how I'm doing.
"How are you feeling today Tom?"

But mostly I appreciate Indie because we share something in common
and that is our application of humor on the volleyball court.

Indie has a unique superpower of being able to make herself cry and sneeze on demand.
I haven't seen anything like it.
In one game she came up to me between sets crying and begging to be able
to play the next set.  I said, "No.  But if you can sneeze for me, I'll think about it."
She promptly started sneezing and I put her in.

And just last week in practice we got another classic Indie epesoide.
It was mid practice, the team was behaving rowdy, and we were trying to switch gears into 
a new drill.  Indie got impaicent and grabbed the next and tightly pressed her face into it.
This happened right in front of me and the image that immedicately popped into my mind
was that of Jack Nicholson coming through the door in The Shinning:  The "Here's Johnny!" scene.
But then instead of "Here's Johnny", in this perfect, naggy, old woman voice, she yells "Hey!  Rotation One!".

It was about the most perfect piece of on-court commedy I have ever seen.

I begged her to do it again and let me take a video, but she wouldn't do it.

I did my best to reproduce her voice and  ...
And then Abby our setter, she sets me this perfect ball out of nowhere, those one of
of a thousand sets you know that you will absolutely crush it.
Rolling around on the floor, she asks in a level, calm voice,
"Tom, what rotation was it again?"

I pressed my face to the net and channel my best angry old woman.
"Rotation One!"






# Abby

Abby is one of my returning players.  She was C-Team with me last year.

Abby or Gale.  Early on Abby asked be to call her Gale so as to avoid confusions with our
other Abi, Abi Reyes.  "Gale?"  I was confused.
But I started writing Gale on our lineup sheets and stuff.  But then she sees it
and says "Gail is not spelled G-A-L-E, it's G-A-I-L.  Abigail."  I didn't understand the connection until then.
Apperantely neither did her Mom.  At an away game I gave her the sign out sheet, but she couldn't find her kid.
I had to explain that her daughter now prefers to be called Gail.

Speaking of names, Abby had the tendency of calling me by a lot of alternative names: Tommy, Tommy-Boy, Tommy-O, and the like.
I've had to explain to her that our athletic director does not approve of players addressing coaches like that.
And that she should instead address me as "Coach Tommy-boy" or "Coach Tommy-O"

Abby or Gail.  Loves to play.  And she is very direct.  She is always, always asking to play.
"Send me back in.  I didn't get to serve last time."  "But I only played for 7 points."
And I don't mind that.  I love kids to want to play more.
But usually she does it when I'm heads down between sets trying to formulate the 6 magic
numbers that go on the lineup sheet.  For those of you who don't know, coachs have to submit
a lineup for the next set one minute before the next set starts.  We only have 3 minutes
between sets, so two minutes to talk with the team and generate these 6 magic numbers.
It's only 6, how hard can it be?  It's frustratingly difficult.
I've gotten so many yellow cards this season for turning in a lineup late.
"Sorry, we have to issue you a yellow card, because lineups are due 1 minutes prior to
the start of the next set."  Whatever...

Note to players: For me the biggest stressor is deciding who gets to play when.
Our team is pretty well balanced, so it's not a question of best vs not-best
players.  For me it's about trying to balance play time.
If I pulled you out this season, it was almost never that I thought you were playing
badly, but that I wanted to give someone else an opportunity.
I hope you can understand that.



# Abi



# Prudence

In one of our first practices last spring, I was
help Coach Jesi with the names of the kids.
"And the tall one over there.  I think
her name is Prudence."  She smiled,
of course because it was her daughter.

Prudence is another one of our quiet kids.
But I discovered early on it was ease to triggar her with humor.
And as a bad coach I'd use it to pick on her.
I'd catch her an opportune moment just when she was about to execute
a play and then make some sort of joke in an attempt to get her
to fall apart in uncontroble laughter.
I know it sound mean, but It was so much fun.

One particular day I was running hitting lines,
tossing the ball for the setter, and typically Prudence
is pretty stoic on the court, not very animated,
but on this particular day I look over to my left
and I see Prudence right behind me, she's got this look in her eye,
she's crouched, her fingers are extended, she looks like this jaguar
that is about ready to pounce.
So naturaly I immediately stop what I'm doing and comment,
"Hey Prudence!  You look like a jungle cat ready to spring!"
Then I quickly toss the ball to the setter, the setter
sets it, but the ball just falls to the floor.
Poor Prudence is not getting enough oxygen because she is laughing so hard.
Point Tom!

Prudence was second string to Bailey on the right side.
Typically she would sit out the first set, play
about half the second set, and they play the full third
set to all Bailey a chance to play in the following varsity match.
But being second string doesn't tell the whole story.
In some ways, Prudence is one of the stronger hitters on the team.
I've seen her connect on some balls harder than most anyone else on the team.








# Bailey

# Sofia

Sofia came to me at the beginning of the season to ask if their
was a chance to move up to JV.  Shortly after, Lily was promoted to varsity,
opening a spot and she was the best canadiate to move up.
At the time Coach Jesi commented on what a leader Sofia has been for C-Team
and she definately carried that to JV.

Along with her positive energy, she turned out to be one of our
most consistence hitters on the team.



# Stephanie

Didn't play last year.  First time I got to meet Stephanie.
Kids settle into they peppering partners.  I hope for an odd numbered
team so I get to pepper with someone.  This year Stephanie became by
peppering buddy.  (Cadence, you remember you were may peppering buddy last year).

As a defensive specialist, Stephanie started as pretty good at passing
and continued to improve throughout the season.  We started a little game
where I'd hit at her, she'd dig, and I'd continue to hit, and we would see
how long we could keep it going.  We asked the team to try it.  We could keep
it going longer than the other pairs.

As a senior I enquired what she has planned for next year.  I was surprised
to hear her list of target schools and that she planned to go into neuro-science.
As an advocate to increase girls going in to STEM, way to go Stephanie.

I got mixed up and put Stephanie in at front row during Senior Night and she crushed it.



# Sadie

Quiet on the court until you ask her a question, then she pipes right up.

One game I has toying with the idea of trying a 6-2.  This was just before
a game and the players were freaking out.  I was doing my best to explain
that it's actually very simple: a 6-2 is just rotations 1, 2, and 3 of a 5-1
repeated twice.  But the team wasn't having any of it.  Sadie was
being her cool, stoic self, not saying much.  I turned to her has asked,
"Sadie, are you freaking out about his too?"
She goes from compely stoic, to "No!  Of course not!" all smiling.

A couple interesting things about Sadie.  She's average height and a setter,
but did you know she has a crazy vert?  She logs verticals just short of Chayse,
Lily, and the other super jumpers on our team.
And one time we ran an endurance run in the gym with the whole team and
Sadie placed with 1st or 2nd out of everybody.  I completely did not expect
this.  So I ask her, "Sadie, do you run track."
She says, "No!  I don't even exersize!"  (I think I added the no exersize
bit, but that's exactly how she said it.)





# Merritt

One of the first to come to me early season to express concerns about 
some players behaviors and her desire to want to build a strong, friendly team.

Enthusiastic about learning to hit quick sets out of the middle.  Often
calls for ones and thirty-ones in warmup, even thought to get one of those sets
in a game is really hard.

Fantastic server, was often our lead off batter.
In one of our wins early in the season she had a string of really hard serves
beyond the level that our opposition could play to.
I started to feel bad for them and considered subing Merritt so it would stop.

Merritt, one of our many player who wants to do it all: hit outside and even play back row.



# Wren

Super vocal, super entusiastic, always positive.

One of my greatest joys this season is letting Wren rotate through and play front row.
She positively freaked out and enjoyed it.  She played the net very well and was hitting strong.
Coach Melissa was sitting next to me at the time and commented that Wren could be a strong front row player.
