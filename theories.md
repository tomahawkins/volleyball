# Unconventional Volleyball Strategies with Analysis and Verification

This is a collection of unconventional volleyball theories for
various strategies and tactics, loosely backed with some analysis and
suggested tests for verification.
In all likelihood, these theories are wrong.
Yet maybe there are one or two gems in here that can break new ground.

The target level of play is NCAA Women's Division II.

# Theory: Sliding Pull Shot (from Foosball)

Idea is borrowed from the foosball [pull shot](http://www.foosballsoccer.com/pull-shot.html).
Setter sets a back 31 for a slide.  Hitter runs parallel to the net with
the ball and has a window along net that she can choose to hit,
potentially enabling her to selectively hit around the block.

Blockers will have a hard time judging where to block.
Watching the hitters body won't give much indication of when they are going to leave the ground.
To gauge where the shot is going to be,
an effective blocker has to watch the hitter's feet and the ball at the same time.

Left-handed hitters could run a pull shot on the left side.


# Theory: Attack in 2 is undervalued.

A free ball sent to the front of the court provides excellent
opportunity to launch a hitting attack in 2 touches.  Though setter dumps are
common, an opposing team is almost never expecting a strong hit on the
second touch.  The passer simply needs to place the ball at the net to an awaiting hitter.
Unfortunately when this opportunity presents itself, this tactic is rarely employed.

- Link to Russian setter attack vs Brazil in Olympics.


# Theory: Blocking to pass vs. blocking to block.  Blocking to pass yields better outcomes.

- Blocks that deflect sideways vs off the top are more detrimental.
- Pushing (penetrating net) increases likelihood of waterfall.
- Goal is to:
  - use the block as an extra pass
  - provide a controlled, energy absorbing deflection to defenders
  - protect the middle court
- Angle arms and hand back to deflect ball up, not down.
- Net penetration is not critical, less jumping energy expended by blockers.
  - Lower jumps may reduce touch out of bounds.
- Spend more time getting into position and less time jumping.
- Analysis: Outcomes of side deflects vs over top deflects.
- Combined blocking to pass with attack-in-2.

# Theory: Slide hitting is more effective than 2 foot take off hitting.

- Can't get as high, but can use body rotation to increase hitting speed.
- Measure outcomes of 1 vs 2 foot takes off hits.

# Theory: Left side setter, twin right side hitters.

- 2 players running slides: one in the middle, one of the right side.
- Middle runs a pull shot, right side runs a fast slide.
- Outside hitter (left) hitting 1s and 2s on the left side.
- OH can fake a 1, and a backrow player can come up from behind and set the ball
  into the corners or the doughnut.

# Theory: Out of system play.

- From back court, Libero sets a fast pass to middle.
- Middle, with back to net and facing pass, jumps and deflects ball left or right.
- Not a hard time, but change in direction will confuse defense.


# Theory: All quick set offense.

What happens if offense almost always sets quick:  31 outside, 1 middle, sliding pull shot on the right.


# Theory: Situations for reduced blockers.

- 1 or no blockers on a out-of-system set from middle to back row.
- 1 or no blockers on a bad pass or if a non-setter is setting.
- 1 or no blockers on identified weak hitters.
- Only 1 blocker on tight sets where blocker can easily get their hands around the ball.
- Only 1 blocker for hits out of the middle. Rational here is that the outsides have a hard time getting to the middle on semi-quick sets. Maybe better if they fall back to dig.
- No blockers after a certain point in a long volley. Everyone is getting tired and hitting weak. Let the front row conserve energy and get in good attack position.


# Theory: No spin best metric for server quality.

- No spin creates the most unpredictable floaters.
- It's easy to gauge spin on a serve.
- Train and measure players' serve at every pratice, graph progression.


# Symetric Front Row

Right-side hitters are underused and undervalued.
Everyone expect the outside to be the default.
We should be setting the right-side the same percentage as outside.

- Setter sets from middle, faces either left or right, depending on situation.
- Setter uses either P1 or P5 as home position.
- Symetric pin hitting.  Right-side can call huts and gos.
- Middle calls either front or back on the fly, depending on the situation.
