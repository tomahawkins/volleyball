# Skills Introduction and Practice

## Hitting Drills

- Approach timing and jumping hitting lines.
    - Focus on timing and maximum jumping, not hitting the ball.
    - Players are instructed not to swing, just lightly hit,
      so they focus on the primary task.
    - Each hitter handsets their ball to the setter.
    - Every attempt is made to attack regardless of set condition.
    - Practice both two-footed and slide takeoffs.
    - Message:
        - Each jump we expect maximum effort.
        - It is better to be on time or late.  Do not be early.
        - Expect all players to jump and hit well, including defense.
        - No such thing as a perfect set.  Make the most of every opportunity.
          Attempt to attack every ball.

- Hitting lines.
    - Same as above, but with arm swing.

- Specific hits: unique hits that take specific practice.
    - Fast tempo:
        - Outside hut.
        - Rightside red.
        - Middle 1, 31, back 1.
    - Slide (all positions).
    - Backrow attacks.

- Combination hitting plays.
    - X: middle 1, rightside cross 2.
    - Fake X.


## Blocking Drills

In all blocking drills defense players practice digging behind the block.

- Single blocker, prepositioned, simple jump.
    - Multiple lines hitting 2.
    - Focus on tracking player, not ball.
    - Time the jump correctly.
    - Message:
        - Blockers watch the hitter, not the ball.

        - Like hitting be on time or late, not early.
        - Push, seal the net.
        - Proper hand and wrist position to protect fingers.
        - Blocking is a counter attack, blocking is NOT a defensive strategy.

- Hitter coverage.
    - Message:

## Passing, Setting, and Combined Drills

- Two passers, equidistant from ball.
    - Ball is tossed in the middle of two passers.  They must resolve who passes the ball.
