# Skills Introduction and Practice

## Hitting Drills

1. Approach timing and jumping hitting lines.
    - Two setters, two hitting lines, one for left and right side.
    - Each hitter handsets the ball to the setter to practice overhand passing.
    - Players do not swing, just lightly tap, to focus on timing and jump.
    - Every attempt is made to attack regardless of set condition.
    - Practice both two-footed and slide takeoffs, long and quick sets.
    - Instruct team to watch for good and bad form in others and self assess.
        - Good form:
            - Maximum approach acceleration, maximum jump.
            - Adjusting early steps of approach to compensate for set position and timing.
            - Maximum arm reach, meets the ball at the apex of the jump (on time).
            - Lowering the arm to compensate for timing (late, that's ok).
        - Bad form:
            - Stopping approach to wait for the ball (too early).
            - Using a slow approach to wait for the ball (too early).
            - Jumping too early and can't reach the ball (too early).
            - Having to backup to get to the ball (misread set).
    - Message:
        - We expect maximum effort for each jump.  A strong jump leads to a strong hit.
        - Be on time or late.  Don't be early.
        - All players must jump and hit well, including defense.
        - No such thing as a perfect set.  Make the most of every opportunity.
          Attempt to attack every ball.  Learn how to compensate for imperfect conditions.

2. #1 with arm swing and strong hitting.
    - Message:
        - Do everything you did in #1.  Do not lapse back into bad form.

3. #2 adding a player to practice digging hits.

4. #3 adding a player to practice blocking.

## Blocking Drills
