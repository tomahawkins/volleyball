"Before I refuse to take your questions, I have an opening statement."

"It's true hard work never killed anybody, but I figure, why take the chance?"

"Thomas Jefferson once said, 'We should never judge a president by his age, only by his works.'
And ever since he told me that, I stopped worrying."

stands on the shoulders of that generation.
You will have opportunities beyond anything we've ever known."

# Game Day 9/14

"You can often change your circumstances by changing your attitude."

"We do not have to become heroes overnight.
Just a step at a time, meeting each thing that comes up,
seeing it as not as dreadful as it appears,
discovering that we have the strength to stare it down."

"I am who I am today because of the choices I made yesterday."
-- Eleanor Roosevelt


- When things go wrong...
  - There will be a point in the match where we are struggling: serve receive, offense, defense.
  - Expect it.  Prepare for it.  Recognize it when it is happening and call it out.
  - It's all psychological.
  - Think less, feel more.
  - Keep talking positive to your teammates.  Let them know your in it with them.
  - Expect bad things will still happen, but not for long.
- Serving

  - Get in close on every hit with arms open.
  - No one should be standing around watching.
- Middles
  - Coordinate with setter and plan for 1s.
  - A hard dumped ball scores just as many points has a hit ball.
  - Often easier to dump straight down than to hit straight down.
- Pins
  - Let's speed up the tempo.  Coordinate with setter for huts and reds.  Maybe gos.
- Out-of-system
  - Pins: See an out-of-system and call for 5x5.
  - Backrow: Watch each set and anticipate an off set.  Call for the hit immediately.

# Practice Plan 9/11


"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.
They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.
You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
Because they change things.  They push the human race forward.
And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”
--Steve Jobs

# Practice Plan 9/4

"But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal?
And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain?
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?

We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
not because they are easy, but because they are hard,
because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills,
because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept,
one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."
--John F. Kennedy

"Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." --Oscar Wilde

# Skills Introduction and Practice

## Hitting Drills

1. Approach timing and jumping hitting lines.
    - Two setters, two hitting lines, one for left and right side.
    - Each hitter handsets the ball to the setter to practice overhand passing.
    - Players do not swing, just lightly tap, to focus on timing and jump.
    - Every attempt is made to attack regardless of set condition.
    - Practice both two-footed and slide takeoffs, long and quick sets.
    - Instruct team to watch for good and bad form in others and self assess.
        - Good form:
            - Maximum approach acceleration, maximum jump.
            - Adjusting early steps of approach to compensate for set position and timing.
            - Maximum arm reach, meets the ball at the apex of the jump (on time).
            - Lowering the arm to compensate for timing (late, that's ok).
        - Bad form:
            - Stopping approach to wait for the ball (too early).
            - Using a slow approach to wait for the ball (too early).
            - Jumping too early and can't reach the ball (too early).
            - Having to backup to get to the ball (misread set).
    - Message:
        - We expect maximum effort for each jump.  A strong jump leads to a strong hit.
        - Be on time or late.  Don't be early.
        - All players must jump and hit well, including defense.
        - No such thing as a perfect set.  Make the most of every opportunity.
          Attempt to attack every ball.  Learn how to compensate for imperfect conditions.

2. #1 with arm swing and strong hitting.
    - Message:
        - Do everything you did in #1.  Do not lapse back into bad form.

3. #2 adding a player to practice digging hits.

4. #3 adding a player to practice blocking.
