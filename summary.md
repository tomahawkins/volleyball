# Blocking: Do Div II Teams Block Too Much?

Blocking point losses due to waterfalls, deflections, enabling re-attacks, etc.


## Test: Outcomes from blocks touched vs blocks missed.

Based on whether a block made contact, measured
probability of block scoring a point or enabling a counter attack.

Results:

- Advantage gained from touched blocks:  44%  (223 / 522)
- Advantage gained from missed blocks:   48%  (299 / 522)


## Test: Outcomes from variable number of blockers.

Measured probability of block producing a positive outcome based on number of blockers.

Results:

- Advantage gained from 0 blockers:  70%   ( 97 /  139)
- Advantage gained from 1 blocker:   47%   (191 /  407)
- Advantage gained from 2 blockers:  52%   (570 / 1100)
- Advantage gained from 3 blockers:  54%   (  7 /   13)

Comments:

- 70% for 0 blockers mostly due to an identified weak hit and blockers pull off.
- Only 5% gain from going from 1 to 2 blockers.  Is it worth it?


## Possible strategies:

- No blocking on back row attacks.
- Reduced blockers on a out-of-system set from middle to back row.
- Reduced blockers on a bad pass or if a non-setter is setting.
- Only 1 blocker on tight sets where blocker can easily get their hands around the ball.
- No blockers after a certain point in a long volley.

## Questions:

- Outcomes of blocks with side deflections vs. deflections over the top?
- Blocking to pass vs. blocking to block?




# Slide Hitting

Pull shot slide: A slide hit off of a back shooting set.  Similar to a foosball pull shot
with the same advantages:  Hitter has a window where they can choose where to hit.

Measured probability of scoring from different types of hits.

Results: frequency of hit type and scoring rate:

- Backrow    :    Hit%:  5.8% ( 53 / 911)    Score%:  9.4% (  5 /  53)
- Right-side :    Hit%: 13.4% (122 / 911)    Score%: 32.0% ( 39 / 122)
- Left-side  :    Hit%: 43.0% (392 / 911)    Score%: 26.0% (102 / 392)
- One        :    Hit%: 11.7% (107 / 911)    Score%: 33.6% ( 36 / 107)
- Two        :    Hit%: 12.7% (116 / 911)    Score%: 37.1% ( 43 / 116)
- Slide      :    Hit%: 13.3% (121 / 911)    Score%: 43.0% ( 52 / 121)

Comments:

- Wow, slide at 43%.
- Left side has high totals and low score % because it is the default for out-of-system play.
    - Is there better alternative for out-of-system?
- A 2 is more effective than a 1?

If slides are really that effective, is it possible to design a slide centric offense?

- Move setter to left facing right to directly support the slide hitter.
- Two slide hitters at center and right pin with left pin hitting 1s and 2s
  from behind the setter, thus leveraging the top 3 most efficient hits.
- Front row setter out of middle, left and right pins each hit slides,
  where left pin hits inverse pull shots (hitter and ball traveling in opposite,
  converging directions).




# TODO: Effectiveness of Front Row Setter

A back row setter is the default strategy for the reason that it
increases hitting options from 2 to 3 front row attackers.
But increasing attack options is not the same as increasing attack force.
There are several benefits to setting out of the front row:

- Post serve positioning and serve reception is easier.
- Three dedicated passers in the back row.
- Less front row congestion, e.g. middle not tangled up with setter on bad pass.
- Setter receivers fewer balls, thus fewer setter-out situations.

This seems like a lot to give up just for increasing attack options by 50%.

Possible study: Measure the outcomes of points when one team has
a setter in the front row and the other team has their setter in the back row.

Most accurate if both teams are running a 5-1.
A team running a 6-2 may be weaker and will never contribute to
front row setter outcomes, which could bias the results.

Preliminary Results:

2632 points measured where one team has the setter in the front and 
the other has the setter in the back row (inferred, assumes 5-1 with
setters starting in p1 and p2).  Of these, 1355 (51.5%) points
were won with setter in the front row and 1277 (48.5%) points won
with setter in the back row.
