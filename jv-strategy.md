# Strategic Plan for JV

"The code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules."
  -- Captain Barbossa


# General Philosphy

- **Safety Before All Else**
    - Where your ankle braces.
    - Protect your head.  Shield it with your arms when in the line of fire.
    - Report all possible injuries and head contacts.
    - Watch over your teammates.  Spot and callout hazzardous situations.
    - Don't get in a situation where you are alone with an adult: coaches, other parents, etc.
        - Most sexual assult victums know the perpetrator.
    - Identify signs of a preditor grooming a potential victum: you or your teamates.
        - Undue attention, "accidental" touching, contacting via side channels: social media, text.
    - Buddy system at all times when you need to leave the group.  Groups of 2 ok, 3 is stronger.
    - Arrange rides in advance.  We get back late, after dark on away games.
    - Learn First Aid and CPR.
    - Be comfortable calling 911.
- **Eat Well, Sleep Well, Study Well**
    - Big meal 3-4 hours before practice and games.
    - Hydrate and eat after practice and games.
    - 8-10 hours of solid sleep each night.  Leave the phone outside of your room at night.
    - Devote the time to excell at your school work.  Ask for help if you need it.
      The best athletics are often the best students.  It all counts for college.
- **Intentional Practice**
    - Use every contact as a chance to get better.
    - Get out of your comfort zone.  Get comfortable being uncomfortable.
    - Failure is how we learn.  If you fail, "So What?"  Push yourself to lean new things.
      Don't shy away from something because you think it's hard.
    - Try things.  Introduce variation and see what happens.
      If a small adjustment in movement creates a positive outcome,
      try a bigger adjustment.  How far can you push it?
      If a small adjustment creates a negative outcome, try going the other way.
      Explore the whole envelop.
    - Interest compounds.  Small improvements everyday lead to big changes over the season.
- **Well Rounded Players**
    - We value the well rounded player over the specialist.
    - Defensive players are expected to jump and hit the ball,
      hitters need to dive and dig, and everyone needs to set and serve well.
    - Karch was not the best at anything, but really good at everything.
- **Team**
    - Respect, support, and encourage your teammates.
    - You are instrumental in helping your teammates get better, improving the team as a whole.


# On the Court Mindset

If you are not touching the ball at a given moment you need to
be thinking: What is the next play and how do I get ready for it?

Areas where we are too slow to think:

- Covering the hit.
- Setter not getting to the setting position on time.
- Blockers not transitioning to a hitting approach fast enough.
- Not helping teammates when they are scrambling to save a ball.



# Warmup

Shoulder Warmup:
As soon as you are in the gym, grab a ball and warm up your shoulders against the wall.
Start pounding balls when you are warm.  Both arms.
Compete with your teamates: the lounder, the higher, the better.

N+2 Approach Warmup:
We don't care how many steps you take as long as the last two are two.
And you swing your arms.
- Run from the baseline to the net and jump with N+2.
- Run back back to mid court then back to the net and jump.
- Run back back to 10' line then back to the net and jump.
- Run back to the baseline then repeat.

Presicion Passing Warmup:
- Ball with a group of 3 in a triangle.
- Two overhand passers pass back to forearm passer.
- Forearm passer passes from hip opposite target.
- Switch from setting to occasional hits.

Rapid Fire Hitting Lines:
- 3 hitters, 3 blockers, 1 setter.  One cart full of balls.
- Set quickly to all hitters at random.  Those out keep the hopper full.
- Reload and regroup.

Float Jump Serve Practice.


# Approach

Master the N+2 step.  Don't care how many steps you take
as long as the last two are two and you swing your arms.

- Warmup: From baseline run to the net and jump with N+2.
    - Run back to mid cournt and back and jump.
    - Run back to 10' line and back and jump.

# Forearm Passing

- Pass from the opposite hip of where you want the ball to go.
- Leg slightly back.
- Drop the shoulder.  Wall, not table.

# Overhead Passing, Setting

- Overhead pass whenever possible, more accurate.
- Step into the ball to build mometum.
- Use your legs to push further.


# Serving

4-step float jump serve is the default.
Everyone needs to get good at this.

# Serve Receive

# Hitting

# Blocking

# Symetric Front Row

Right-side hitters are underused and undervalued.
Everyone expect the outside to be the default.
We should be setting the right-side the same percentage as outside.

- Setter sets from middle, faces either left or right, depending on situation.
- Setter uses either P1 or P5 as home position.
- Symetric pin hitting.  Right-side can call huts and gos.
- Middle calls either front or back on the fly, depending on the situation.

1. Have Fun
2. Improve  (learn, adapt, overcome, get better)
3. Promote Health  (get strong, increase endurance, prevent injury, physical and mental)


It's possible to have fun, but not improve.
It's possible to improve, but not have fun.
It's possible to stay healthy, but not have fun nor improve.

We need all three.


If a question arises -- should we or should we not do something --
how it would affect our 3 principles.


What about winning?

Winning is usually fun.
So if we win, we will probably be satisfying principle #1.
But if winning means only letting the best players play, is that still fun?  No.
If players don't play, are they learning anything?  No.
Can we find a way to have fun even when we loose?  Playing in a highly competitive,
evenly matched game is a lot of fun, regardless of the outcome.

Winning is fun, but it often doesn't teach us much.
We learn from mistakes; losses can teach us far more than wins.








Learning is great.
Learning how to learn is even better.
We all face new and difficult challanges.
Develop a common set of tools you can reach for to learn, adapt,
and overcome new challanges.

- Growth vs fixed mindset.
- Intentianal practice.  Every touch is an opporunity to get better.
- Try things.  Introduce variation and see what happens.
  If a small adjustment in movement creates a positive outcome,
  try a bigger adjustment.  How far can you push it?
  If a small adjustment creates a negative outcome, try going the other way.
  Explore the whole envelop.
- Get out of your comfort zone.  Get comfortable being uncomfortable.







# Core Strategies

1. Core Strategies
2. Founding Theories
3. Derived Tactics

Core strategies are our guiding principles of how we approach the game.

Founding theories are perceived truths about the game,
which will shift, change, and grow, as our understanding improves and matures.

Derived tactics are specific methods based on the founding theories
designed to increase our chance of success at game time.



## Team Supporting Team

What can I do to help my team get better?

Everyone has a bad day.  Help them out.

Team spirit.  Team apparel for every practice and travel.


## Intentional, Maximal Practice

Make every contact an opportunity to get better,
using feedback to improve.
Maximize contacts per practice.

- Lots of game play with fewer players per team.
- Drills with pairs or triples.  No waiting in line.


## Athletic Diversity

Some of the best volleyball players are multisport athletes.


## Feedback

Feedback makes us better.

Identify useful tactics that are easy to measure and qualify.

### Feedback from Yourself

- After every contact, analyze.
- Did I know what I was doing before I did it?
- Was I in the right position?
- Was the contact clean?
- Did the ball go where I wanted it?
- What did I do good?
- What could have I done better?
- Try small adjustments to see if it improves or worsens.

### Feedback from your Teammates

- Give feedback to your teammates.  Often.  Practice and games.
- State the tactic and give a plus (boom or whoop) or minus (come on!).
  - "Zero Spin Serve.  Boom!"
- Make it quick, don't make a big deal out of it, don't be a jerk.

### Feedback from your Games

- Analyze every game (real games and practice ones).
- What went well?
- What didn't?
- See a teammate struggle to get something right?
  - Take them aside and talk about it.
  - Be curious, not judgment (thank you Ted Lasso).
  - You might help them Escape Local Minima.


## Escape Local Minima

We all get stuck in performance plateaus.

Sometimes we need to get our of our comfort zone to learn
strange new skills to become a better player.


## Identify Improvements, Generalize, and Apply

See something work well?  Can a similar tactic we applied elsewhere in the game?

Applying benefits to other areas of the game is a force multiplier.

Example: Wow! That fast hit threw the defense off.

Identify: The quick hit was hard to counter.  The defense didn't have time to set up.

Generalize: Shortening the time from defense to attack can lead to a point.  How else can we shorten the time?

Apply: Keep passes low and fast, but still accurate.  This also speeds up the attack.


## Learn with Critical Thinking

Lots of YouTube videos.  Identify the good advice from the bad.  Both are useful.








# Founding Theories and Observations

- Slides are more efficient that 2-footed takeoff hits.
- Zero spin serves increase aerodynamic flutter.
- Fast attacks have higher likelihood of success.
- Blocking poses many risks.
  - Touch out of bounds.
  - Returns ball allow opponents to attack again.
  - Side block deflections hard to dig.
  - Net violations.
  - Ankle injuries.
  - Finger injuries.
- Well rounded players better than specialists.








# Core Tactics


## Just Average

Elevate the level of everyone's overall play.
Do not emphasize specialization.

Out of system play happens all the time, everyone must
compensate and perform during the unexpected.

- Everyone passes: No libero.
- Everyone hits: 6-2 over a 5-1.
- Everyone blocks: All players play MB.
- Everyone sets: 6-6.


## Inside Voices

Strong, assertive communication.
Over powers a cheering crowd.  Intimidates opponents.
Projects and strengthens self confidence and team confidence.


## Logistics and Support

Predict and identify when a teammate needs help.  Never wait for a call for help.
On a shanked pass or used block, immediately establish the "supply line" to
get the back back to the other side.

Support your teammates on and off the court.  Something as simple as fetching a bottle
and offering water can make all the difference.


## Ready Five

If you are not touching the ball or lining up to hit or block,
just assume next the ball will be hit hard in your direction.

Always be ready to pass.

Predict where the ball is going to go and be there in advance.


## Fast Attack

- Fast transition from defense to offense.
- Fast, accurate passing.
- Fast, low arcing sets.
- Quick hits.


## On Two

When possible, attack on the second hit.


## Zero Spiny

Serves and downballs with zero spin have greater likelihood of
aerodynamic flutter, making them hard to pass.
Drive spin to zero.


## Block to Pass

Goal is to have the block deliver the ball up in the air in middle court
so it acts as a pass.
Block to cover hits to the middle of the court.
Don't penetrate the net.  Don't push.
Don't jump high.  Don't get used.
Angle slightly back.
Minimize chance of ball going off the side of the block.


## Late and Fast


## Pull Shot

Slide hitters run with the direction of the set, can decided when to hit the ball
along the net to make an opening in the block.


## Set from Left, Middle on Pin, Two Sliders


## Reduced Block

Situations to reduce the number of blockers down to 1 or none.

- Out of system.  Set from middle to back row.
- Bad pass, setter out.
- Identified weak hitter.
- One blocker on a tight set.
- One blocker on a middle set.  Rational: Outsides can't get in on time.
- No blockers after a certain point in a long volley.  Everyone is getting tired and hitting weak.
  Let front row conserve energy for hitting.


## Eagle Eye

Lots of serves fall near the endline.  Passers have a hard time judging in vs out.
One player (maybe, position #1) dedicated to calling in/out on the serve.
